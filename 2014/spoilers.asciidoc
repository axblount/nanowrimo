Overall
=======
- Need to setup locations better.

Plot Points
===========
- He gets to work it's all burned down, everyone is dead. Out front there's 
a note that says welcome Sten with a mop and bucket. Bonus: Somehow the 
construction of the greeting display caused the fire. Got it: fireworks.  
A charred corpse hangs out the second story window. The company made fire 
alarms, they were all desensitized to fire alarms. They all went to chastise the 
person who didn't turn off the alarm, the fire spread and the fireworks went 
off.

Rewrites
========
- Need to add a setting. Tucson seems like the best choice. Right now it's too 
nebulous. Even if it's fictitious I should define it.
- grep for NOTE and TODO
- Change how the fire started. Make it so everyone was gathered in the break 
room or something.

Plot Holes
==========
- Fire investigation happens too fast.
- Forgot to add the teacher to the bus scene. The teacher should have a disk as 
well.

Motifs
======
- A unique and highly irregular stream of profanities

Vague Ideas
===========

squirting flowers pretend to sneeze on people
- An ammonia based life form uses Cosgrove's smell salt e-cig to survive on 
earth
