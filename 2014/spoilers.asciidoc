Overall
=======
- Need to setup locations better.

Plot Points
===========
- He gets to work it's all burned down, everyone is dead. Out front there's 
a note that says welcome Sten with a mop and bucket. Bonus: Somehow the 
construction of the greeting display caused the fire. Got it: fireworks.  
A charred corpse hangs out the second story window. The company made fire 
alarms, they were all desensitized to fire alarms. They all went to chastise the 
person who didn't turn off the alarm, the fire spread and the fireworks went 
off.
- Cedar says, ``Always look for the anomaly. Here, the anomaly is you.''

Rewrites
========
- grep for NOTE and TODO
- Change how the fire started. Make it so everyone was gathered in the break 
room or something.

Plot Holes
==========
- Fire investigation happens too fast.

Motifs
======
- A unique and highly irregular stream of profanities

Vague Ideas
===========
- a aliens sensitive to acetic acid. carry a squirt gun. Wear one of those

- An ammonia based life form uses Cosgrove's smell salt e-cig to survive on 
earth
